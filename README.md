## Couple words..

- It is hard for me to say anything about myself
- If I could choose I would rather talk about my loved ones
- Like Yoda, who is sitting right next to me now and begging to give him some apple
- An always hungry podengo with unreasonably big ears.
- He is the always favorite of my partner and me as well - and of course everybody who meets him. Nobody can resist him...

My beloved partner is already sleeping so I have to be fast with my words.
If I had to I would tell [these] things about me.

> My family is my partner and our four-legged "terminitor".
> Ex sausage addict in childhood, but almost fully vegan now.
> I love playing, especially with Divinity, Unravel, Tac and Catan.
> Animal rescuer with the most amazing team I could ever wished for <3
