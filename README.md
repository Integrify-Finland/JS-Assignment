These exercises were designed to help learning basic skills in javascript

## Prerequisites

Create a Github account if you haven't and setup your [ssh key](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) for authentication.

## Instructions

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repository to your Github account. Then [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the fork to your machine, make commits and push to your fork. Then open [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to the original repository.

Optionally, you can also run test against your code:

1. Install dependencies: `yarn`

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable

> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.
